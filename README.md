# `Q` and `$Q`

## Introduction
- `Q` is a utility function for safely executing a function and returning its result, or `undefined` if an error occurs.
- `$Q` is the asynchronous counterpart to `Q`, designed for handling async functions or promises.

## Syntax
```javascript
Q(functionOrValue)
$Q(asyncFunctionOrPromise)
```
## Parameters
- functionOrValue (Q): A function to execute or a value to return.
- asyncFunctionOrPromise ($Q): An async function to execute or a promise to resolve.
## Return Value
- For Q: The return value of the executed function, or undefined in case of an error.
- For $Q: The resolved value of the promise or async function, or undefined in case of an error or rejection.
## Error Handling
Both Q and $Q return undefined when encountering an error, providing a safe and concise way to handle exceptions.

## Examples
Using Q
```javascript
let result = Q(() => mightFailFunction());
console.log(result); // Outputs the function's return value or undefined
```

## Using Q with a Value
```javascript
let value = 'example';
let result = Q(value); // Simply returns the value
console.log(result);
```
## Using $Q with an Async Function
```javascript

let fetchData = async () => {
  let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return response.json();
};

let result = await $Q(fetchData);
console.log(result); // Outputs fetched data or undefined on error
```
## Using $Q with a Promise
```javascript
let promise = fetch('https://api.example.com/data').then(res => res.json());
let result = await $Q(promise);
console.log(result); // Outputs fetched data or undefined on error
```
These functions are especially useful for reducing the need for repetitive try-catch blocks and for simplifying error handling in both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

# `ptr` Function Documentation

## Introduction
The `ptr` function is designed to emulate pointers in JavaScript. It creates a sealed object that acts as a reference to another object, allowing for pointer-like behavior.

## Syntax
```javascript
ptr(object)
```
## Parameters
- object: The object to which you want to create a pointer.
## Return Value
Returns a sealed object with a single property * that references the passed object. This object acts like a pointer to the original object.

##vDescription
ptr creates an object with no prototype (using Object.create(null)) and assigns the provided object to a property named *. It then seals the new object using Object.seal, preventing new properties from being added to it and existing properties from being removed, effectively making it a read-only reference to the original object.

This function is useful for scenarios where you want to ensure that multiple parts of your code are referring to and modifying the same object, emulating pointer-like behavior found in other programming languages.

##Example
```javascript

let originalObject = { key: 'value' };
let pointerToObject = ptr(originalObject);

console.log(pointerToObject['*']); // Outputs: { key: 'value' }
originalObject.key = 'newValue';
console.log(pointerToObject['*']); // Outputs: { key: 'newValue' }
```
In this example, pointerToObject acts as a pointer to originalObject. Any changes made to originalObject are reflected when accessing pointerToObject['*'].
